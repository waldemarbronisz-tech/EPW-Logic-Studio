# EPW Logic Studio Architecture

## 1. Engine & Runtime Separation
The visual IDE canvas and the Runtime are explicitly decoupled.
The `ExecutionEngine` holds absolutely zero UI references. All time logic resolves through an injected `TimeProvider` interface and external signals resolve through an `IOProvider`.

## 2. Cycle Scan Semantics
1. Acquire inputs (evaluate all blocks starting with `input.*` against the IO provider).
2. Execute Topological Graph.
3. Propagate output connections to downstream inputs.
4. Evaluate logic blocks.
5. Push outputs (evaluate all output blocks, triggering writes back to IO Provider).
6. Wait for next interval.

## 3. Schema Versioning
- Development format: `format: "EPW_LOGIC"`, `schema_version: 1`
- Compiled format: `format: "EPW_RUNTIME_LOGIC"`, `schema_version: 1`

## 4. Stateful Feedback Execution
Pure combinational logic feedback (e.g. `AND` looped back into itself) is prohibited. However, the compiler explicitly permits feedback if a node along the cycle is flagged with `is_stateful = True` (e.g., `TON`, `RS`, `SR`). This satisfies industrial loop criteria where latency exists through memory buffers.

## 5. Lifecycle and Restarts
The engine uses strict PLC-like stop/restart semantics. Upon encountering an `EngineState.STOPPED` state, a transition into `EngineState.RUNNING` triggers all instantiated Logic Blocks to execute `reset_runtime_state()`. The method zeroes all dynamic outputs, timer values, and edge triggers ensuring clean deterministic behavior irrespective of the memory states when the system halted.

## 6. Time and Testing Boundaries
All logical timings are evaluated deterministically using an injected `TimeProvider`.
- `SystemTimeProvider` implements standard Python monotonic checks for local production testing.
- `SimulationTimeProvider` allows testing logic graphs across hundreds of artificial ticks instantaneously by explicitly iterating `engine.time.advance()`, explicitly ensuring CI headless environments aren't reliant on wall-clock `time.sleep()`.
